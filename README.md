# job-pod-reaper

Kubernetes service that can reap pods that have run past their lifetime, or pods that have been evicted.

## Configuration

To give a lifetime to your pods, add the following annotation:

`pod.kubernetes.io/lifetime: $DURATION`

`DURATION` has to be a [valid golang duration string](https://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration).

A duration string is a possibly signed sequence of decimal numbers, each with optional fraction and a unit suffix, such as "300ms", "-1.5h" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "Âµs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h".

Example: `pod.kubernetes.io/lifetime: 24h`

The above annotation will cause the pod to be reaped (killed) once it reaches the age of 1d (24h)

## Deployment Details

The job-pod-reaper is intended to be deployed inside a Kubernetes cluster. It can also be run outside the cluster via cron.

The following flags and environment variables can modify the behavior of the job-pod-reaper:

| Flag    | Environment Variable | Description |
|---------|----------------------|-------------|
|--no-remote-exec       | REMOTE_EXEC=false   | Set to run job-pod-reaper outside the Kubernetes cluster, requires kubeconfig be set |
| --cron-job            | CRON_JOB=true       | Set to only execute reap code once and exit, used when run via cron   |
| --reap-max=30         | REAP_MAX=30         | The maximum number of jobs to reap during each loop                   |
| --reap-interval=60    | REAP_INTERVAL=60    | The number of seconds between each reaping execution when run in loop |
| --reap-namespaces=all | REAP_NAMESPACES=all | Comma separated list of namespaces to reap                            |
| --pods-labels         | PODS_LABELS         | Comma separated list of Pod labels to filter which pods to reap       |
| --job-label=job       | JOB_LABEL=job       | The label associated to objects that represent a job to reap          |
| --kubeconfig          | KUBECONFIG          | The path to Kubernetes config, only needed with --no-remote-exec      |
| --log.level=info      | LOG_LEVEL=info      | The logging level One of: [debug, info, warn, error]                  |
| --log.format=logfmt   | LOG_FORMAT=logfmt   | The logging format, either logfmt or json                             |
